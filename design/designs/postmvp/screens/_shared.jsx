/* THE POST-MVP TREE'S OWN PRELUDE. `render-screens.mjs` prepends this file to
   every board in this tree, the way canonical's `_shared.jsx` is prepended to
   its own: screen-level layout that is not a design-system component lives
   here once.

   IT HOLDS LAYOUT, NEVER COPY. Everything a reader reads is on a board or in a
   design-system master, so a line of blessed copy exists in exactly one place
   in this tree. What lives here is the two column shapes these boards share —
   the settings page's body and the notification list's — each the same shape
   canonical draws, because a post-MVP board that sat in a different column
   would be showing a different app.

   THE SETTINGS BOARDS ARE EXCERPTS, and `SettingsExcerpt` is what says so.
   Canonical's `SettingsBody` is the whole page and the master; a copy of it
   here would drift from that master the first time a canonical group moved.
   So a board in this tree draws the groups its ruling is about and the groups
   on either side of them, which is what pins a placement, and nothing else.

   THE DESTRUCTURE NAMES WHAT THIS TREE USES, not everything the bundle exposes:
   a board reaches a design-system master by its bare name, and this is where
   that name comes from. */
