# Copy and voice

The rules of `design.md` §7, with the product's own examples. See
`readme.md` §3 for the condensed version.

## The two hard rules about numbers

**Numbers are in scope.** CoGra's ranking is not a black box, and the UI
must not behave as though it were. A post can show what it scored and why
it sits where it does, opening into the actual paths behind it. Showing
the number is the honest move; withholding it would be the opacity this
product exists to refuse.

Two rules keep that from becoming noise:

1. **Every number shown is explainable** — traceable, on demand, to what
   produced it. A figure with no path behind it is the black box again,
   just smaller.
2. **Detail is layered** — a calm surface by default, the arithmetic a
   tap away, with the density partly the reader's own choice.

## The vocabulary that stays off the screen

Words describing how the thing is built rather than what the reader is
doing: **graph, node, edge, vertex, tensor, weight, parameter,
decentralized, protocol, token, crypto**. The repo's own internal
vocabulary is equally out: *valence*, *connection*, `p_d`, `p_i`.

The rule is "as little as possible, as much as needed", not a word ban.
Where the format *is* the content, name it exactly: a key export that
won't say PEM, PKCS#8, hex, or Ed25519 is an export nobody can feed to
another tool. Codes, keys, and recovery are the reader's own vocabulary
on those surfaces. Plain language frames the block; the precise label
sits on it.

This is greppable and is enforced as a check over Android's `strings.xml`
and the web copy, rather than left to review.

## Register

Write from the reader's side. Active voice. **A control says what will
happen; the confirmation says what happened.**

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| `Sign and publish` | `Submit` |
| `Signed — it's in the thread now, still settling.` | `Success!` |
| `That didn't send. Try again.` | `Error: request failed (500)` |
| `Nothing here yet — write the first post.` | `No results` |
| `You're browsing as a guest — sign in or join to post and vouch.` | `Sign up now to unlock CoGra!` |
| `It takes 3 signed actions, each paid for separately.` | `This may incur charges.` |
| `Inviting unlocks once your application is approved.` | `Feature locked` |

Sentence case everywhere. No title case, no all-caps, no exclamation
marks outside a genuine welcome (`Approved! Your registration is
landing`). Em dashes carry asides; `…` marks work in progress.

## Emoji

Used in exactly one place: the stance readout (twenty anchors, plus 🤷 for
a zero standing and 😐 for a control at rest). These are system emoji
rendering a value, not decoration. **Never** in headings, buttons,
marketing copy, empty states, or documentation of features. The `→` in
`Just looking? Browse the feed →` is the only other glyph used as
punctuation.

## Honesty phrasings to reuse verbatim

- `Still settling` — content authored, not yet ordered.
- `Edited` — an edit, marked softly.
- `Nothing was signed just now.` — the coach mark's first line.
- `Signing needs your key, which isn't in this browser — the write waits
  as pending.`
- `Your standing toward this post drops to nothing. It stops reaching
  your feed, you stop earning from it, and nothing passes on through
  you.`
- `A signing key can only ever back one account, so this account needs
  its own.`
- `This is the only way to restore your key.`

## Naming

The product is **CoGra** in prose. The wordmark is lowercase `cogra`.
Handles are shown with `@`. A person or group is an *actor* internally
and never on screen — on screen they have a name and a handle.
